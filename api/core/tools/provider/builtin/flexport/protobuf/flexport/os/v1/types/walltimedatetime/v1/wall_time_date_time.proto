// A datetime as perceived by a user in a timezone.
//
// The term "wall time" refers to the definition here:
// https://www.w3.org/International/articles/definitions-time
//
// Use this message type only when you are certain that (1) the value you want to represent is a
// specific date and time AND (2) you want to represent time _as perceived by a user_ rather
// than an absolute time relative to epoch.
//
// Example use case:
//
// - Warehouse empty container pickup availability. The value could represent a future date time
//   ("the warehouse staff is expecting to have the empty ready for pickup at 9am on Monday") or
//   a past date time ("the container was made available to pick up at 2pm today").
//
// Consider using google.protobuf.Timestamp instead to represent:
//
// - Historic system-level events such as "created_at" for an entity or "sent_at" for a system
//   message. These times should be represented relative to epoch rather than with a timezone.
//   If IANA timezone offsets change, that should not impact the times of these events.
//
// Consider using WallTimeDateOrDateTime instead to represent:
//
// - Values that could be _either_ a specific datetime _or_ a date (example: a pickup could be
//   scheduled for March 1st and actually happen at 3:30PM on March 1st.)
//
// For more background, see http://go/datetimes.
//
// Note that this value cannot be used to represent a "date or date time" value. It always
// refers to a specific point in wall time in the timezone. For example, if hours, minutes,
// seconds, and nanos are omitted, then the message refers to midnight on the year, month, and day.
// That is, the message does not mean "any time during the day on this year, month, day".
//
