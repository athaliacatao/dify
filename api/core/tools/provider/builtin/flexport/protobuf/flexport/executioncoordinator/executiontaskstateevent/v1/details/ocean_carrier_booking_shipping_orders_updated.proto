// A digitized shipping order has been changed.
// The shipping order document provides information about the space that was released by the ocean carrier after a carrier booking is confirmed.
// It specifies the route, the number and types of containers, and the cutoff dates for submitting documentation and the deadline to drop off their container(s) at the container yard.
// A carrier may release space on a booking as either a single shipping order or many (up to one shipping order per container).
// In the real world, the shipping order is a PDF that is usually attached to an email that is sent to the origin agent by the ocean carrier.
