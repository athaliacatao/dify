//Description: AllotmentContours specify the particular ULD types procured on a particular allotment.
//1 Allotment will have many AllotmentContours. For example, an allotment representing space procured on flight CX100,
//might have 2 AllotmentContours: 1) 1 Q6 with 2800kg of allotted space 2) 1 Q7 with 3200kg of allotted space
//Usage: This proto will be used as the contract to publish allotment data to snowflake
//This proto maps to the table air_procurement_allotment_contours.
