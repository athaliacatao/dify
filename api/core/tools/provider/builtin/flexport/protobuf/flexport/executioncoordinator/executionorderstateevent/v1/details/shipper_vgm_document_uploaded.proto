// Verified Gross Mass (VGM) document has been uploaded by the shipper to Flexport.
//
// A "Verified Gross Mass Declaration" (VGM) is a document required by the Safety of Life at Sea
// commission. It is required to have the numbers and gross weight of each sealed/packed container
// in a shipment.
//
// Flexport receives VGM data from the shipper. It then transmits the VGM data to the ocean carrier.
// Shippers can submit VGM data either as a PDF or via a structured form. See PR comment [0] for
// details about how the monolith handles these interactions and http://go/ocean-fcl-lifecycle for
// a full walkthrough of ocean FCL documents.
