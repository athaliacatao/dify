  // Cargo that we tender as one or more fully built-up ULDs, that the airline
  // breaks down and releases loose at destination. This can happen for several
  // reasons:
  //
  // - Airlines may offer to fly consolidated cargo bound for different
  //   destinations to their hub airport, break down the ULDs, then fly (or
  //   truck) the cargo to one or more final destination airports, where we
  //   retrieve it loose. In this case, the cargo is tendered intact, but flies
  //   under several MAWBs: one for each destination.
  // - In a capacity squeeze, other forwarders sometimes pay top dollar to put
  //   their freight on our procured space. We can mix their cargo with ours in
  //   the same ULDs which we tender intact at origin, but we can't retrieve it
  //   intact at destination because we're not a full party to the MAWB. So the
  //   airline breaks it down and releases it loose.
  // - We might simply ask the airline to break the ULDs down for us at the
  //   destination terminal, if this turns out to be more cost-effective, or if
  //   we don't have a warehouse at destination.
  //
  // In the first two scenarios listed above, breakdown is mandatory. In the
  // third scenario, it's optional.
  //
  // There may be other reasons to use this handling type. Do not treat this as
  // an exhaustive list!
