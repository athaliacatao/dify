// There are around 2100 unit of measures based on few websites.
// The unit of measures can be country specific and there is no
// global list. Hence this is not an enum.
// For US Imports valid unit_of_measure strings are defined in...

// The unit_of_measure field is validated against the "Proprietary Format Code" column of the above link.
// In future, we can add other fields to this type to facilitate unit

//   - physical_property - enum of quatities like length, mass, etc
//   - conversion_factor - factor to convert to base units like meters & kg
